Introduction
------------

`dolmen.forms.crud` is module destined to help developpers create
their C.R.U.D forms using `Grok`, `z3c.form`, `megrok.z3cform` and
`dolmen.content`. It provides a collection of base classes to add,
edit and access your content. It also provides some hooks to customize
the field per context/form using special adapters, to avoid overriding
existing form and to increase the pluggability of your application.


dolmen.content
--------------

`dolmen.content` is a simple framework to create content types with
Grok. Associated with `dolmen.forms.crud`, the task to create and
manage content types has never been simplier.
